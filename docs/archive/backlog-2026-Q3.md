# Backlog snapshot, 2026 Q3

Items completed and moved out of [`backlog.md`](../backlog.md). This file is append-only history;
the live backlog carries active items only.

## Completed 2026-08-07

- **Re-run the installer on this host and confirm it completes without the seven `Set-Acl` errors it
  printed before.** The one acceptance criterion of
  [`plans/subprocess-and-hardening-fixes_spec_v1.md`](plans/subprocess-and-hardening-fixes_spec_v1.md)
  that named this machine. Passed on the second attempt: the first refused on a state-root artifact,
  which is the defect that plan's Chapter 4 records, and the run after that correction reported
  `Verified 77 hardened path(s)` and `Provisioned` with no `Set-Acl` error.
- **Run operator check E** from [`operator-checks.md`](../operator-checks.md), the verification the
  mirroring effort could not close from code. Passed in full: a mention and a timestamp inside a
  fenced code block render as literal text, an escaped line-leading quote opens no blockquote, and
  `-NoMirror` stopped one session's mirroring while another running beside it kept mirroring. Both
  claims the chip escape rests on are now observed rather than inferred.
